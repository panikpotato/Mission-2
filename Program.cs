//Write a .NET console application using C# that simulates the rolling of two 6-sided dice (NOTE:
//NOT a one 12-sided die.) Use an array to keep track of the number of times that each
//combination is thrown. In other words, keep track of how many times the combination of the two
//simulated dice is 2, how many times the combination is 3, and so on, all the way up through 12.
//Allow the user to choose how many times the “dice” will be thrown. Then, once you have that
//number of rolls, pass that number to a second class that has a method that simulates the roll of
//the dice for the number of times that the user specified. Store the results in an array. The method
//in the second class should return that array containing the roll results to the first class. In the first
//class, use that array to print a histogram (using the* character) that shows the total percentage
//each number was rolled. Each * will represent 1% of the total rolls.
